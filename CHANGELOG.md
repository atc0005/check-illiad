### Added

Initial release!

This release provides an early version of a Nagios plugin used to check the
status of email notifications for an ILLiad instance. In particular, this
plugin looks for notifications in a `Pending` status that have remained that
way at a specific number and length of time. Default values may be usable
as-is, otherwise are easily overridden with command-line flags. See the README
file for additional details.
